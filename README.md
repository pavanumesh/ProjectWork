# Real Time Assistive Shoe for Visually Impaired People
Visually disabled people come across many challenges on a daily basis, some challenges are new and some routine.

Most of the times the blind typically use traditional canes that cannot detect the objects higher than the waist. The innovation with one of the wearable technology aids underprivileged visually impaired people with a new merge for eyes-free navigation in an environment that is in identifying the obstacles ahead of them and moving to the destination through a navigation path. More importantly, when visually challenged people using this wearable technology need not carry any other additional support instruments. This technology is embedded into the shoe part, making the footwear powerful in determining the obstacles ahead of the bearer.
