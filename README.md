The battery can play an important role in achieving the target of universal access to clean, reliable, and affordable electricity services, Batteries provide energy for powering devices without wires or cables. The use of a battery has changed human life in terms of carrying electricity around and storing it in a small size box, this is still a very under-explored part of the industry as there is a lot of room for research and development. The thought was to find an alternative for Li-ion battery and lead acid battery that is equally efficient but made of cheaper metals that are found in the scrap metal and are about to be recycled

By depositing an oxide layer of thickness in the nanoscale to protect the alloy from degrading in the electrolyte, and studying its characteristics and composition before and after the Formation of the oxide layer on the alloy. With the help of this, hoping to bring up a new set of directions in recycling or productively reusing the metals instead of throwing them out. The process that is included is to create an oxide layer on the top of the electrode to prevent decay

Here presented the find ball-cell battery device developed entirely from scrap metals of brass and steel-two of the most commonly used and discarded metals. At room temperature chemical processes in developed to convert brass and steel into functional electrodes for rechargeable energy storage that transforms these multicomponent alloys into redox-active iron-oxide and copper-oxide materials. The simplicity of this approach, building from chemicals commonly available in a household enables a simple pathway to the local recovery, processing, and assembly of storage systems based on materials that would otherwise be discarded
